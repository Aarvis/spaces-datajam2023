Problems
1) For a blended in-game Ad to happen there are a lot of players involved like 
game assets designers from gaming studio
event organizers of the Esports event
sponsors
When sponsoring to Player it involves the Player as well.

Sponsors lack the data of player 
The history of the estimated view time a player has received playing in Esport events. 
The key moments he has generated which would be used in a recurring basis on all social media or short media platforms like replays, best plays and reels.
There is no product available to provide the performance metrics of the player in terms of view time generated.

Added to This, The sponsor has no immediate tool to visualize how the in-game blended Ad will look like with his assets immediately.

Event Organizers Should not have any problem managing in-game assets, they shouldn't do more than copy pasting assets, in a single click, at the effort by them to provide blended in-game ads must be minimal

The process of generating branded skins must be automated for sponsors, game designers and Players.

There no single place for sponsors to bid for digital spaces in Esports events, bidding for player gun spaces, glove spaces, wall spaces etc...


Players and Esports Organizers have an additional revenue stream.
Sponsors get more effective eyeballs.

Performance metrics of the Ad can also be shown after the Match is over.
Key Moments can be suggested during the real-time game, making it easier for forecasters to create replays and game clippings as shorts.

We can extend it as a plugin as well for every esport events.
Facilitating Simple Dynamic Asset changes match over match for sponsors and event organizers
